<h2>Design Process</h2>
<p>The idea and design for the project appeared while creating a seminar paper on visualizing resumes. There have been several iterations of the design for frontend, backend, and functionality of the system. The client-side design will be improved and the back-end wil change completely throughout the next few months as the <em>Global Resume Standard</em> is developed and brought to life.</p>
